"Sun"
1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9 and out

All waiting for the light
Have fear, fear not
The sun shines out of my eyes
She will not go down tonight

... and the world counts loud to ten

One... here comes the sun
Two... here comes the sun
Three... she's the brightest star of all
Four... here comes the sun

The sun shines out of my hands
Can burn, can blind you
If she breaks out of my fists
Ice lay down on your face
She would not go down to night
And the world counts loud to ten

One... here comes the sun
Two... here comes the sun
Three... she?s the brightest star of all
Four... here comes the sun
Five... here comes the sun
Six... here comes the sun
Seven... she is the brightest star of all
Eight... here comes the sun

The sun shines out of my hands
Can burn, can blind you
When she breaks out of my fists
Ice lay down on your face
Lays painfull on your chest
The balance come to loss

Lets you go down hard
And the world counts loud to ten

One... here comes the sun
Two... here comes the sun
Three... she?s the brightest star of all
Four... and will never fall from heaven
Five... here comes the sun
Six... here comes the sun
Seven... she is the brightest star of all
Eight... here comes the sun
